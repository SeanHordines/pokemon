175,Flail,Base power increases as the user's HP decreases.,1,0,50,100,15

181,Powder Snow,Has a 10 chance to freeze the target.,15,1,40,100,25
182,Protect,Almost always goes first. The user is protected from all attacks for one turn but the move's success rate halves with each consecutive use of Protect Detect or Endure. If a Pokemon has No Guard or used Lock-On or Mind Reader against the user during the previous turn its attack has a [100 Varmove's 1 accuracy] chance to hit through Protect; OHKO moves do not benefit from this effect. Blizzard has a 30 to hit through this move during Hail as does Thunder during Rain Dance.,1,d+,0,,10

If the user of this move has Skill Link this move will always strike five times.,5,0,25,80,10
199,Lock-On,This move ensures that the user's next attack will hit against its current target. This effect can be Baton Passed to another Pokemon. Lock-On fails against Pokemon in the middle of using Protect Detect Dig Fly Bounce or Dive as well as Pokemon behind a Substitute. If the target uses Protect or Detect during its next turn the user's next move has a [100 Varmove's 1 accuracy] chance to hit through Protect or Detect.
